# IP Address Range Expander

## Description
`expand.py` is a Python script designed to expand a set of IP address ranges and CIDR notations. 
It takes a comma-separated list of IP ranges and CIDR notations as input and generates a comprehensive list of individual IP addresses that fall within those ranges. This tool is useful for network administrators, security professionals, and anyone needing to analyze IP address ranges.

## Features
- Accepts both IP address ranges (e.g., `192.168.1.1-192.168.1.10`) and CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).
- Outputs a complete list of individual IP addresses in plain text format.
- Handles invalid input gracefully and provides error messages for invalid ranges.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
